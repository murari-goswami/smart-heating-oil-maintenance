Heating oil are one of the energy source for modern house holds. However, this comes with a cost. This generates a substantial amount of CO2 and causes adversal affect on climate. 
With an optimized and intelligent way of consumption, distribution and storage one can make an smart energy system. This can aparently help in contribution to the sustainable 
environment.

This Smart heating oil maintenance makes use of Machine Learning Random Forest Algorithm to intelligently deduce when and how much heating oil will need to be 
filled for winter and summer seasons across european countries. So cool!!

According to the analysis performed on the data, the model is x% accurate. ðŸ˜Ž

It's â™» THE PERFECT SUSTAINABLE HACK â™» for an efficient heating oil system.
Oil prices are on an increasing price trajactory and equally not efficient for climate. It should be burned efficiently and sustainably both from environment and economic perspective.
